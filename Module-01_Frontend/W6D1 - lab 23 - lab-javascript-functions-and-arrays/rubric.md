# Generic Lab Rubric

<br><br>

In order to assess each of your mandatory lab and ensure all requirements are met, a **rubric** will be used. This rubric is used to **evaluate each of the labs** by your teaching staff but also to **communicate** what constitutes incomplete, acceptable and excellent performance across each of the learning outcomes. Take some time to review the rubric and ask your lead teacher any questions about it if necessary.

<br>

| **Learning outcomes** | **Domain** |**0 - Incomplete** | **1 - Fair** | **2 - Good** | **3 - Excellent** |
| --------------------- | ---------- |------------------ | ------------ | ------------ | ----------------- |
| ***Completed each of the mandatory iterations correctly.*** | Server-side development, Client-side development, Databases, Software Architecture | Student has made little effort to complete the iterations, and work submitted is incomplete or incorrect. It is clear that student has not understood the concepts covered in the day. | Student has made some effort to complete the iterations, but overall is either missing some of the mandatory iterations, or work submitted is only partially correct indicating student has not understood all of the concepts in the day. | Student has completed all of the mandatory iterations are submitted and are correct, showing that core concepts from the day have been well understood and implemented. | Student has completed all of the mandatory iterations correctly and gone the extra step to submit some or all of the bonus iterations. Student has shown they have clearly understood all of the main concepts of the day and taken the time to practice everything. |
| ***Commented code where appropriate*** | Code Quality | Student has made no effort to comment any of their code. | Student has commented some code with room for improvement. | Student has commented code sufficiently and to a good level across all of the iterations where necessary. | Student has commented their code to an exceptional degree across all iterations and it would be clear to any developer what they have done and why. |
| ***Followed clean code principles and best practices where appropriate*** | Code Quality | Student has not followed clean code conventions. Indentation has not been implemented making code hard to read and naming best practices have not been followed. | Student has made some effort to follow clean code principles but there is room for improvement. Code could be easier to read and naming of best practices could be improved. | Student has followed clean code conventions and best practices very well. Code is easy to read with consistent formatting and structure. | Student has followed best practices following clean code principles to a professional grade standard. |


### Mandatory vs. Optional labs

Mandatory labs have clear delivery date and will be considered as not submitted unless submitted before the deadline.
Submission of these labs is one of the mandatory requirements for your successful completion of the course (your graduation).

Optional labs don't have clear delivery date and won't be checked as a requirement for graduation. However, it is highly recommended that you finish these labs as well as working on the mandatory ones will require understanding previously covered concepts and your opportunity to practice these concepts is in labs.
